Create a modular command-line Todo List application in Python.

Split the app into the following modules:
1. todo/models.py — Contains a Task data class with fields: id, description, completed.
2. todo/storage.py — Handles saving/loading tasks using JSON.
3. todo/cli.py — Provides user interaction: displaying tasks, getting input.
4. todo/main.py — The main script running the app loop with actions: add, list, complete, exit.

Each module should:
- Follow clean, readable Python standards.
- Handle basic error conditions.
- Be importable and testable separately.

Start with models.py. Generate all files one by one in the specified order. Do not generate test files.
